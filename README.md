# Basic-Calculator-Project

<h3> In this project, the calculator application is coded in C# language. It is a simple yet functional application that provides several functionalities.</h3>

<p>
• Users will be prompt to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation).<br>
• Next, user will be asked to enter 2 numbers.<br>
• The application will perform the selected operation and display the result.<br>
• When the result is displayed, there will be a message prompt to ask if user wish to continue to perform other operations.<br>
• If user decide to perform other operations, user will be asked to select an operation again.<br>
• At the end of using the calculator, it will show a history of the records of previous calculation.<br>
</p>

<h4>In this application, there are several error handling to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the calculator.</h4>

<p>
• Handling of invalid user input for operation selection<br>
• Handling of invalid user input for entering non-numeric values<br>
• Handling of invalid calculation such as dividing by zero<br>
</p>

<p>
<h4>Other than the basic implementation of the calculator, I included the bonus feature such as:</h4>
<p>
• Allow users to perform additional operations such as exponentiation (Included as one of the operation selection)<br>
• Dislay a history feature that records previous calculations (Included at the end of the application)
